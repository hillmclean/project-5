## Technology Used

In this repo, you will find the following files:

- HTML & PHP

## Personal Learnings 

A new skill I learned in this project was how to implement and use Ajax and REST APIs in WordPress. It also helped me strengthen my skills in the following areas:

- Wordpress Loops and Functions
- JQuery Conditions
- AJax
- APIs
- CSS & Sass
- PHP 

## Personal Reflection 

This project expands on all the skills I have learned thus far while in RED Academy's Web Dev Professional Program. It was a good challenge and I feel like when I am becoming more confident in JavaScript and CSS skills.
